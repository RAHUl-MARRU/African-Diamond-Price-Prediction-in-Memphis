# African-Diamond-Price-Prediction-in-Memphis
Fundamentals of Data Science - ML Project

# PROJECT GOAL AND SCOPE 

The goal of the project was to solve the problem of predicting the market price of African diamonds in Memphis a month in advance. The solution was proposed to be a working python program with a relative error (RE) of at most 20% on average.

# CASE STUDY

A prediction problem was done by author Sanjoy Mondal [1], forecasting the market price of diamonds in the United States. As a part of the study Sanjoy has made use of various prediction algorithms such as linear regression, Decision tree, and Random Forest regressor. In that Random forest regressor got best performance, when comparison models with better metrics score with a relative error (RE) of at most 20% on average than other models. This was key to my project since I tried the same kinds of solutions.

Sanjoy did the histogram distribution plot to show the frequency price of how often each different value in a set of data occurs on his dataset.

# Results of evaluation:

The R-squared error score is the metric used to evaluate the quality of the prediction models above after fitting the training data and testing it on the test data.

Prediction Models	          R-squared Error score

Linear regression	          0.79%

SVM regressor       	      0.66%

Decision tree regression	  0.83%

Random forest regressor   	0.95%
